											<h2>Which ransomeware locked your files?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Firstly you need to identify the ransomeware that infected your computer. Fortunately, two sites exist to help with this.
									
											<ul>
											<li><h3><a href="https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ID Ransomware</a></h3>

These guys help you to check which ransomware has encrypted the data. You need to upload the any encrypted file and note, which shows the name and payment information.<br>
It detects for more than 250 types of ransomware.
</li>
											<li>
											<h3><a href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">No More Ransom</a></h3>
											You would require uploading any encrypted file (not larger than 1 MB) to No More Ransom, and they will advise if there is a solution available to decrypt the file

											</li>
											
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p>Once the name of the ransomeware is found, come back here to RELIABLY download a tool below FOR FREE to decrypt your files. Simply enter the name of the ransomeware that locked your files to find the tool below.</p>

The ransom note asks you to contact \"decryptioncompany@inbox.ru\", \"fwosar@mail.ru\" or \"fabianwosar@mail.ru\". To use the decrypter you will require a file pair containing both an encrypted file and its non-encrypted original version. It is important to use a file pair that is as large as possible, as it determines the maximum file size up to which the decrypter will be able to decrypt your files. Select both the encrypted and unencrypted file and drag and drop both of them onto the decrypter file in your download directory.", link: "https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/fabiansomware" },
{ name: "Emsisoft Decryptor for Philadelphia", desc: "Philadelphia is a ransomware kit offered within various hacking communities. Written in AutoIt, it encrypts files using AES-256 encryption, file names using RC4 encryption and uses the *.locked file extension. It is based on a similar ransomware kit called \"Stampado\" that is written by the same author. To use the decrypter you will require a file pair containing both an encrypted file and its non-encrypted original version. Due to the file name encryption this can be a bit tricky. The best way is to simply compare file sizes. Encrypted files will have the size of the original file rounded up to the next 16 byte boundary. So if a the original file was 1020 bytes large, the encrypted file will be 1024. Select both the encrypted and non-encrypted file and drag and drop both of them onto the decrypter file in your download directory.", link: "https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/philadelphia" },

In order for the decrypter to work you will require both the email you are asked to contact as well as your ID. Please keep in mind that both are case sensitive, so proper capitalization does matter. Please put both information into the appropriate fields in the options tab. Since version 1.17.0 each Stampado infection also has a unique \"salt\" that is specific to the ransomware buyer. The salt can either be specified manually or detected automatically. In order to determine the salt automatically the ransomware has to be running on the system. Fill in the ID and email address and click the \"Detect ...\" button next to the salt input field. If the malware has already been removed, please don't attempt to reinfect yourself. Instead submit the malware file via email to fw@emsisoft.com so I can extract the correct salt for you.
